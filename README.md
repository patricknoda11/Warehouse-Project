# My Personal Project - Escape To The Moon

### Introduction: 
“Escape To The Moon” is a simple Java desktop game designed with all ages in mind. 
This game interests me because it provides an environment that will challenge my abilities,
and allows me to apply what I have learned. 
This game was constructed to provide students and workers a quick break
The game models a rocket’s ascent into space.
There will be meteorites that are descending at varying speeds. 
If the Rocket is struck by the meteorite the game will conclude followed by the word “Game Over”. 
The purpose of the application is to dodge the meteorites without getting hit for as long as possible. 
There will be a score that will accumulate based off the time the rocket
is able to ascend without getting hit by a meteorite 

### How To Play
The rocket will be able to move from side to side, using the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard. 
Each meteorite will have varying speeds and will be generated at random. 
The score will be accumulating proportional to the time that the rocket is able to avoid the meteorites. The game will be over when the meteorite contacts the rocket.
