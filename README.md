# Warehouse Management Application

### Introduction: 
This application is a simple desktop application that gives the user a way to track their warehouse inventory.
More specifically, it will provide a way to track and process current inventory, track exports and 
imports, view package details, and more. The application is targeted for users that have decided to or just recently
started up a warehouse business. The goal of this application is to provide a short-term alternative
for new warehouse business owners that are not willing to spend excessive amounts of money to purchase a
warehouse management software from the get-go. 
This project is of interest to me because my father has recently started up a warehouse business. By building 
this project I hope to acquire a better understanding of how a warehouse management software operates and discover the 
potential limitations associated with this system.
